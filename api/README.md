# AirBnB Clone: Phase # 3

: API with Swagger

## Description

Project attempts to clone the the AirBnB application and website, including the
database, storage, RESTful API, Web Framework, and Front End.  Currently the
application is designed to run with 2 storage engine models:

* File Storage Engine:

  * [`/models/engine/file_storage.py`](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v3/blob/master/models/engine/file_storage.py)

* Database Storage Engine:

  * [`/models/engine/db_storage.py`](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone_v3/blob/master/models/engine/db_storage.py)

  * To Setup the DataBase for testing and development, there are 2 setup
  scripts that setup a database with certain privileges: `setup_mysql_test.sql`
  & `setup_mysql_test.sql` (for more on setup, see below).

  * The Database uses Environmental Variables for tests.  To execute tests with
  the environmental variables prepend these declarations to the execution
  command:

```groovy
$ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_test HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_test_pwd \
HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_test_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db \
[COMMAND HERE]
```

# Concepts
_For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:_
* [REST API](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/45)
* [AirBnB clone](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/74)

# 1. REST API
REST API is a software architectural style for Backend.

**REST = “REpresentational State Transfer”. API = Application Programming Interface**

Its purpose is to induce performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.

REST API is **Resource-based**, a resource is an object and can be access by a URI. An object is “displayed”/transferred via a **representation** (typically JSON). HTTP methods will be actions on a resource.

Example:
* Resource: `Person` (John)
* Service: contact information (`GET`)
* Representation:
  * `first_name`, `last_name`, `date_of_birth`
  * JSON format

## There are 6 constraints:
## 1. Uniform Interface
* Define the interface between client-server
* Simple and can be split in small parts

#### HTTP verbs
* `GET`:
  * Read representation of a resource or a list of resources
* `POST`:
  * Create a new resource
* `PUT`:
  * Update an existing resource
* `DELETE`:
  * Remove an existing resource

#### URIs - resource name
A resource representation is accessible by a URI:
* `GET /users`: path for listing all user resources
* `GET /users/12`: path for the user `id = 12`
* `GET /users/12/addresses`: path for listing all addresses of the user `id = 12`
* `POST /users`: path for creating a user resource
* `PUT /users/12`: path for updating the user `id = 12`
* `DELETE /users/12/addresses/2`: path for deleting the address `id = 2` of the user `id = 12`

### HTTP Response
In the HTTP Response, the client should verify the information of two things:
* status code: result of the action
* body: JSON or XML representation of resources

Some important status code:
* `200`: OK
* `201`: created => after a `POST` request
* `204`: no content => can be return after a `DELETE` request
* `400`: bad request => the server doesn’t understand the request
* `401`: unauthorized => client user can’t be identified
* `403`: forbidden => client user is identified but not allowed to access a resource
* `404`: not found => resource doesn’t exist
* `500`: internal server error

## 2. Stateless
The server is independent of the client. The server doesn’t store user client information/state. Each request contains enough context to process it (HTTP Headers, etc.)

Some authentication systems like OAuth have to store information on the server side but they do it with REST API design.

## 3. Cacheable
All server responses (resource representation) are cacheable:
* Explicit
* Implicit
* Negotiated

Caches are here to improve performances. In a REST API, clients don’t care about the caching strategy, if the resource representation comes from a cache or from a database…

## 4. Client-Server
REST API is designed to separate Client from the Server. The server doesn’t know who is talking to it. Clients are not concerned with data storage => the portability of client code is improved. Servers are not concerned with the user interface or user state so that servers can be simpler and more scalable

## 5. Layered System
Client can’t assume direct connection to server. Intermediary servers may improve system scalability by enabling load-balancing and by providing shared caches. Layers may also enforce security policies.

## 6. Code on Demand (optional)
Server can temporarily:
* Transfer logic to client
* Allow client to execute logic
* Example: JavaScript

# 2. AirBnB clone

I know you were waiting for it: it’s here!

The AirBnB clone project starts now until… the end of the first year. The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

You won’t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, you will have a complete web application composed by:
* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data (data = objects)
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## Final product

![da2584da58f1d99a72f0a4d8d22c1e485468f941](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/1841b787-c8af-49b4-9c5e-dab0a5633846)

## Concepts to learn
* [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) - and please work all together on tests cases
* **Python packages** concept page
* Serialization/Deserialization
* `*args, **kwargs`
* `datetime`
* More coming soon!

## Steps
You won’t build this application all at once, but step by step.

Each step will link to a concept:

## The console
* create your data model
* manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
* store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine

## Web static
* learn HTML/CSS
* create the HTML of your application
* create template of each object

![87c01524ada6080f40fc](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/704ad78d-053c-4c30-bedc-3d87b19ebc69)

## MySQL storage
* replace the file storage by a Database storage
* map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

![5284383714459fa68841](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/f492838c-4d2a-4a75-8324-cc903634c361)

## Web framework - templating
* create your first web server in Python
* make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database

## RESTful API
* expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
* manipulate your objects via a RESTful API

![06fccc41df40ab8f9d49](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/d0515e05-f4b0-44a7-bbbc-f7ad7ecc159f)

## Web dynamic
* learn JQuery
* load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API

![d2d06462824fab5846f3](https://github.com/elyse502/AirBnB_clone/assets/125453474/50a350bb-2492-4701-a198-ef284721d971)

## Files and Directories
* `models` directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
* `tests` directory will contain all unit tests.
* `console.py` file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
* `models/base_model.py` file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
    * attributes: `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`
    * methods: `save()` and `to_json()`
* `models/engine` directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: `file_storage.py`.

## Storage
Persistency is really important for a web application. It means: every time your program is executed, it starts with all objects previously created from another execution. Without persistency, all the work done in a previous execution won’t be saved and will be gone.

In this project, you will manipulate 2 types of storage: file and database. For the moment, you will focus on file.

Why separate “storage management” from “model”? It’s to make your models modular and independent. With this architecture, you can easily replace your storage system without re-coding everything everywhere.

You will always use class attributes for any object. Why not instance attributes? For 3 reasons:
* Provide easy class description: everybody will be able to see quickly what a model should contain (which attributes, etc…)
* Provide default value of any attribute
* In the future, provide the same model behavior for file storage or database storage

## How can I store my instances?
That’s a good question. So let’s take a look at this code:
```groovy
class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = []
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
```
Here, I’m creating a student and store it in a list. But after this program execution, my Student instance doesn’t exist anymore.
```groovy
class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = reload() # recreate the list of Student objects from a file
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
save(students) # save all Student objects to a file
```
Nice!

But how it works?

First, let’s look at `save(students)`:
* Can I write each `Student` object to a file => _NO_, it will be the memory representation of the object. For another program execution, this memory representation can’t be reloaded.
* Can I write each `Student.name` to a file => _YES_, but imagine you have other attributes to describe `Student`? It would start to be become too complex.

The best solution is to convert this list of `Student` objects to a JSON representation.

Why JSON? Because it’s a standard representation of object. It allows us to share this data with other developers, be human readable, but mainly to be understood by another language/program.

Example:
* My Python program creates `Student` objects and saves them to a JSON file
* Another Javascript program can read this JSON file and manipulate its own `Student` class/representation

And the `reload()`? now you know the file is a JSON file representing all `Student` objects. So `reload()` has to read the file, parse the JSON string, and re-create `Student` objects based on this data-structure.

## File storage == JSON serialization
For this first step, you have to write in a file all your objects/instances created/updated in your command interpreter and restore them when you start it. You can’t store and restore a Python instance of a class as “Bytes”, the only way is to convert it to a serializable data structure:
* convert an instance to Python built in serializable data structure (list, dict, number and string) - for us it will be the method `my_instance.to_json()` to retrieve a dictionary
* convert this data structure to a string (JSON format, but it can be YAML, XML, CSV…) - for us it will be a `my_string = JSON.dumps(my_dict)`
* write this string to a file on disk

And the process of deserialization?

The same but in the other way:
* read a string from a file on disk
* convert this string to a data structure. This string is a JSON representation, so it’s easy to convert - for us it will be a `my_dict = JSON.loads(my_string)`
* convert this data structure to instance - for us it will be a `my_instance = MyObject(my_dict)`

### `*args, **kwargs`

#### [`How To Use them`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-args-and-kwargs-in-python-3)
How do you pass arguments to a function?
```groovy
def my_fct(param_1, param_2):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
```
But with this function definition, you must call `my_fct` with 2 parameters, no more, no less.

Can it be dynamic? Yes you can:
```groovy
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
```
What? What’s `*args` and `**kwargs`?
* `*args` is a Tuple that contains all arguments
* `*kwargs` is a dictionary that contains all arguments by key/value

A dictionary? But why?

So, to make it clear, `*args` is the list of anonymous arguments, no name, just an order. `**kwargs` is the dictionary with all named arguments.

Examples:
```groovy
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

my_fct() # () - {}
my_fct("Best") # ('Best',) - {}
my_fct("Best", 89) # ('Best', 89) - {}
my_fct(name="Best") # () - {'name': 'Best'}
my_fct(name="Best", number=89) # () - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
my_fct("School", 12, name="Best", number=89) # ('School', 12) - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
```
Perfect? Of course you can mix both, but the order should be first all anonymous arguments, and after named arguments.

Last example:
```groovy
def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

a_dict = { 'name': "Best", 'age': 89 }

my_fct(a_dict) # ({'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'},) - {}
my_fct(*a_dict) # ('age', 'name') - {}
my_fct(**a_dict) # () - {'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'}
```
You can play with these 2 arguments to clearly understand where and how your variables are stored.

### `datetime`
`datetime` is a Python module to manipulate date, time etc…

In this example, you create an instance of `datetime` with the current date and time:
```groovy
from datetime import datetime

date_now = datetime.now()
print(type(date_now)) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(date_now) # 2017-06-08 20:42:42.170922
```
`date_now` is an object, so you can manipulate it:
```groovy
from datetime import timedelta

date_tomorrow = date_now + timedelta(days=1)
print(date_tomorrow) # 2017-06-09 20:42:42.170922
```
… you can also store it:
```groovy
a_dict = { 'my_date': date_now }
print(type(a_dict['my_date'])) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(a_dict) # {'my_date': datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 8, 20, 42, 42, 170922)}
```
What? What’s this format when a `datetime` instance is in a datastructure??? It’s unreadable.

How to make it readable: [`strftime`](https://strftime.org/)
```groovy
print(date_now.strftime("%A")) # Thursday
print(date_now.strftime("%A %d %B %Y at %H:%M:%S")) # Thursday 08 June 2017 at 20:42:42
```
